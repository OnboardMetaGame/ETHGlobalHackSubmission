### Onboard is a MetaFi game.

🧠 In itself it is a DAO of DAOs. Its aim is to ensure functioning open
metaverse by onboard a community of gamers, learners, contributors and web3
partners that understand the wide range of issues in the blockchain industry and
have developed the means and understanding to deal with them. (LEARN/CONTRIBUTE)

💰 It’s a token of tokens. It leverages DeFi capabilities by creating a BOARD
token that will be backed by the tokens of different web3 partners that are
integrated into our platform. This allows our community to act as a protocol
politician for important decisions that affect our web3 partners. (EARN/GOVERN)

🎮 It’s a Metaverse of Metaverses. Onboard will use a simple but fun and
engaging metaverse to create an interoperable NFT game that allows users to
develop their on-chain skills in-game. The future vision is to keep the
metaverse lightweight in its graphics and mechanics to make it accessible to a
higher number of individuals from different socio-economic backgrounds.
