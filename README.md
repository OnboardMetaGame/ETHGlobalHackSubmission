### Onboard is a MetaFi game.

ðŸ§  In itself, it is a DAO of DAOs. Its aim is to ensure functioning open
metaverse by onboard a community of gamers, learners, contributors and DAO
partners that understand the wide range of blockchain and societal issues and
develop the means to solve them through a satelite of DAOs. (LEARN/CONTRIBUTE)

ðŸ’° Itâ€™s a token of tokens. It leverages DeFi capabilities by creating a BOARD
token that will be backed by the tokens of different DAO partners that are
integrated into our platform. This allows our community to act as a protocol
politician for important decisions that affect our DAO partners. (EARN/GOVERN)

ðŸŽ® Itâ€™s a Metaverse of Metaverses. Onboard will use a simple but fun and
engaging metaverse to create an interoperable NFT game that allows users to
develop their on-chain skills in-game. The future vision is to keep the
metaverse lightweight in its graphics and mechanics to make it accessible to a
higher number of individuals from different socio-economic backgrounds.
